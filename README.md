# Unreal Engine : Collaborative Work

## First Setup
- Install GitHub Desktop (official, non beta) : https://desktop.github.com/ (Page bottom)
- Create or Login to GitHub on GitHub Desktop
- Ask Dixie Team to create and allow you access to your group repository
- Clone this repository from GitHub Desktop
- Open this Unreal Project now in your repository (UEProject_MasterDMS.uproject)
- Go to Edit > Editor Preferences > Loading & Saving
- Check on "Automatically Checkout on Asset Modification"
- Right click any asset into the Content Browser, and click "Connect to Source Control"
- Select Git, and check if your username and email are ok (don't touch anything else), and click Accept Settings

## Usage
- Right click on folder or file in Content Browser, Mark for Add to add asset on server
- Right click on folder or file in Content Browser, Check In to create new commit for asset (Sync from GitHub Desktop required to push asset to server)
- Right click on folder or file in Content Browser, Refresh to update asset from server
- Right click on folder or file in Content Browser, History and Diff Against Depot to check changes

## Workflow
- Master_Files : use for the final all merged project between all teams. WARNING = modification and add in this location need to be manage by Dixie Team, and a turn by turn upload for each group will be set up. Please don't push anything without the Dixie Team authorization.
- Team_Files : use for each teams to store your own files.

IMPORTANT : a file can be access only by one user at the same time.
We will show you the basics on how to proceed inside Unreal for exchanges and simple workflow.
